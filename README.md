# Bike Sharing Linear Regression model
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

The scope is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
After the analysis, data preparation , prediction and evaluation and building the model here is the summary.

Top 5 predictors that influence bike booking are

1. temp  with coeffecient value of '0.549936' indicates that it has high influence on the bike renting
2. snow(weathersit = 5) with coeffcient value of -0.288021 indicates that it brings down the booking count of bike
3. yr with coeffecient value 0.233056 proves that booking has improved over years
4. winter and 
5. Sep month has also some amount of influence in favouring the bike renting from customers.
